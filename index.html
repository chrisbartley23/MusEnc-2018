    <p><b>Game of Thrones: Main Theme and The Children
    <br>Arrangement for cello, 3 soloists, (percussion) and SATB choir by Chris Bartley
    <br><i>MEI Project: Code score and tie to web videos to display sources for arrangement
    </i></b>
    <p>
      <p>
    This arrangement, performed by the Pitt-Greensburg Chorale in December 2014, brings together two music themes from the HBO series Game of Thrones: The Main Titles, and The Children. Original music for the series was composed by Ramin Djawadi.
    <br>Composer Malukah created an arrangement of The Children for voices and instruments. The arrangement for Chorale begins and ends with inspiration from her work, complete with her nonsense syllables as lyrics, used with her permission.
    <br>Into this arrangement I inserted music from the famous main titles, featuring cello as lead instrument.
    <p>
    Thus, the score below is an amalgamation of the two sources:
    	<ul><li>m1-30: Malukah (slow, contemplative, haunting - featuring 3 solo voices but no cello)
    	<li>m31-61: Main Titles (faster, driving, with theme in cello and voices)
    	<li>m62-end: Malukah (key change, nonsense syllables)
      </ul>
    <p>
    MEI permits rendering of clickable scores. In this case, the goal was have, at click of the starting measure of each of the three sections, to load and play youtube videos that demonstrate source. These clicks would be keyed to the correct moments within the videos.
    <br>This page successfully permits clicking on m1 for the start of the video, and m2 to get to the latter section of the Malukah video (ideally this is on m62, but this measure can't be displayed today. Ah well...).
    <br>The next step would be to have the video switch on click to the Main Title video to show the middle section. Or, have the page load with two video players, and have the correct video and time play for each click.
